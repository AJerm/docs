# XenForo 2.0 Documentation

## Developer Documentation for XenForo 2.0.

Welcome to the initial release of Developer Documentation for XF2.

The documentation hosted in this repo is far from finished, but is still a good start to familiarise yourself with:

* Installing XF 2.0 from the command line
* Familiarising yourself with the new add-on stucture
* Learning some new concepts in XF2 including entities, finders and repositories
* A full tutorial to build your own portal add-on in XF2

Please feel free to post any [issues](https://github.com/xenforo-ltd/docs/issues) you may find with the documentation, but pull requests will not be accepted at this time.

Please also use the [XenForo 2.0 Demo](https://xf2demo.xenforo.com) for help with XF2 development, providing feedback on the Development preview and reporting bugs with the software.
