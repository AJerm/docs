# XenForo 2.0 Documentation

## Developer Documentation for XenForo 2.0.

Welcome to the initial release of Developer Documentation for XF2.

The documentation hosted in this repo is far from finished, but is still a good start to familiarise yourself with:

* Installing XF 2.0 from the command line
* The new add-on structure in XF2
* Some new concepts in XF2 including entities, finders and repositories
* A full tutorial to build your own portal add-on in XF2

Please feel free to post any [issues](https://github.com/xenforo-ltd/docs/issues) you may find with the documentation. If you'd like to contribute changes to our documentation then you should first read our guidelines and other useful information [here](https://github.com/xenforo-ltd/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please also use the main [XenForo community](https://xenforo.com/community) for help with XF2 development, providing feedback on XenForo 2.0 and reporting bugs with the software.
